This is a simple Jobs app project built in react, which allows the users to login using credentials. 
After a successful login the user is redirected to home page from where he can navigate to the different sections of the app.
The user can browse through a bunch of dummy job roles which are fetched using an api call.
The user can filter the jobs based on the filters provided like "employment type", "salary range", and "search".
On clicking the jobs card the user is navigated to a job-details section where he can see the job description and all the necessary skills required for the job.
